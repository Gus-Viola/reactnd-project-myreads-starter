## Introduction

This is a single-page React app which allows you to search books from a Udacity database. The books can be stored
in three different shelves, and moved around. It is a showcase for my skills using the React DOM.

It was built upon the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, which can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter). I added interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code
from the template.

## Installation

* Click on the `<span style="color:green">green "Clone or download" button</span>` above to the right, get all files and folders in your drive.
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`

If you are interested in programming, feel free to [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) and use the code! It is distributed under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).
